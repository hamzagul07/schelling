"""Solver-output and audit data contracts (BUILD_PLAN §3).

``ForecastRecord`` is the product's spine: designed as if a journalist will read it,
because one will. Every solve — even a unit-test solve — emits a complete record.

Session 1 defines the shapes and populates only the fields the vote layer produces
(``weighted_mean``, ``weighted_median``). Fields owned by later milestones — the per-round
octant matrix, offers, sensitivity table, outcome distribution — are typed here and left to
be filled in Sessions 2-3. See DECISIONS.md.
